# Groove Coaster controller (WIP)
Welcome to the Groove Coaster Arcade Controller project! This project aims to create a custom Groove Coaster arcade controller using real arcade parts, a Raspberry Pi Pico, and custom PCBs with Neopixels for enhanced lighting control. With this controller, you can enjoy the Groove Coaster experience at home!

**This project is very much work in progress and is not ready for use yet!**
